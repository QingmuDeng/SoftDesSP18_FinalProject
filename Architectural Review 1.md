## Paletteful Architectural Review: Risk identification and mitigation

### 1. Background and Context

Our original project idea involved colorizing black-and-white images using machine learning and user inputted color hints. However, after reading some research papers on the topic, we found that the best way to colorize black-and-white images would require convolutional neural networks and/or generative adversarial networks, which are complicated machine learning concepts we had no prior knowledge in. After realizing that our project is out of our scope, we decided to pivot slightly and focus on color palettes. We plan to create a desktop app platform that generates color palettes from an inputted image. The principles of color theory would be considered when generating the color palettes, so the output might not merely contain the most dominant colors within the image. From the generated color palette, our app would provide related color palettes obtained through online sources (i.e. COLOURlovers) via web scraping. Possible extensions include generating color palettes based on inputted keywords and themes using machine learning techniques. A more distant stretch goal would be to start using the color palettes we generate to colorize black-and-white images. We have additional ideas regarding color palettes that we plan to delve into during the architectural review.
  
In terms of splitting up work, we plan to have a pair rotation system, in which we have two sub teams working on different major components of the project. The two major components are color palette generation and building the web app/ user interface. Each sub team would work around a week in a teaming environment and then we will reshuffle the teams. We plan to make sure everyone is up to date with all aspects of the code through weekly scrum meetings. 
    
### 2. Key Questions

a. Which color palette application would be most useful for users?

b. How much color theory should we integrate into our color palette generation software? 

c. What do you think about our decision to change from colorization to color palette generation?

d. When should we finish our MVP and transition to our extensions? 

e. What are your thoughts on the pair rotation idea for splitting up work?

### 3. Agenda for Technical Review Session

a. Start with an overview of our project idea (both original and new ideas)

b. Describe potential algorithms that we would implement (i.e. K means clustering) and specific application ideas/ extensions

c. Explain our methods of splitting up work (i.e pair programming rotation structure)

d. Ask for feedback/ awesome ideas
