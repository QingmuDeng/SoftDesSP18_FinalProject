## Paletteful Architectural Review 2

### 1. Background and Context

After working on our project for a few weeks, we were able to reach our MVP. In other words, we can take an input image
and generate three different kinds of color palettes from it. The different palette types include the default dominant/ accent
palette, complementary palette, and analogous palette. We also started building a visually appealing and interactive project
website. Our immediate next steps involve integrating the project website with the color palette generation code and publishing
the website on GitHub. We are also starting the extension parts of our project. This includes using machine learning to
analyze the sentiment of an input image. From the sentiment, we can recommend related palettes to users. The goal of this
AR is to get feedback on what features to focus on for the rest of the project.
    
### 2. Key Questions

a. Determine how useful certain website features will be to users.

b. What features do people think are missing from our website?

c. What are people's thoughts on our generated color palettes?

d. What are people's thoughts about using neural networks to evaluate the sentiment of a given image?
