# Architectural Review Reflection

## 1. Feedback and decisions

We received positive feedback on the scope of our project overall. Several people suggested that we try to focus our goals a bit more, so that we are not attempting to spread ourselves too thin by trying to implement too many features. They suggested that whatever we do, we should stick with color palettes. 

We also found that many people in our class responded positively to the idea where we use color palettes to generate/search for presentation/website themes. Others, who are more interested in digital art, wanted to have color palettes generated that also included shadows, hues, and tints of each dominant color in the palette and presented it in a downloadable .jpeg file that they could transfer to their Photoshop workspace. 

Other ideas we received included generating color palettes based on desired “feelings” or “sentiments” as well as asking the user a list of questions to make their results more specific. Also, someone suggested that we incorporate a tool where the user can block out a section of an image that contains colors that they are interested in, and the program selects colors from within that space to create a color palette.

Overall people seemed interested in the idea of color palette generation and colorization in general, with several people saying that they would use several of our suggested features on at least an occasional basis. 

## 2. Review process reflection

Overall, the review went well. We stuck to our agenda and presented all the ideas and extensions we wanted to. We also asked all of our key questions and got some good feedback from our survey. The presentation slides were quite colorful and aesthetically appealing, which matched with our theme on color palettes and color theory. However, we did not assign slides to people beforehand, so one person dominated the presentation. For future presentations, it would be important to make sure that everyone is equally informed on our processes and plans. We will make sure to assign slides to maximize everyone’s contribution in future technical reviews.
