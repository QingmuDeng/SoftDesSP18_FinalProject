# Architectural Review #2 Reflection

## 1. Feedback and decisions

We received positive feedback on the progress of our project. People generally thought that we accomplished a good amount
of work in the amount of time that we were given. There was an universal acknowledgement of the fact that we were able to
accomplish our MVP, which was to generate nice looking color palettes from an inputted image. People also positively reacted
to the layout and design of our project website.

In terms of additional features we could implement as project extensions, we did not receive as much excitement for our
web page generation feature, so we decided to forgo it due to project time constraints. We will continue with the machine
learning and sentiment analysis feature since people found it quite interesting. Concerns were also raised that integrating
the color palette feature with the project website may be more challenging then it seems, so we are planning to start integrating as soon as possible.

## 2. Review process reflection

Overall, the review went well. We prepared a concise presentation and feedback form. The people participating in our review
gave some good ideas and feedback to our questions. However, only one person filled out our feedback form after the review.
Even so, we recorded some feedback we received during the AR, so we were able to make some important decisions afterwards.
Also, it was good that the website demo went really well, and we distributed the talking more equally this time.
