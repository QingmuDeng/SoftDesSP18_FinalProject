# Project Proposal

### The Big Idea:

The main idea of our project is to create an application that colors black-and-white images. We are thinking of combining this idea with machine learning in order to detect the different objects within the image. Knowing what the input contains in terms of objects would allow for more logical coloring results. We are also eager to delve into the different image processing techniques, including edge detection. Our minimum viable product will be to color black and white pictures of simple inanimate objects. After accomplishing our MVP, the next steps would be to introduce pictures of people and pictures containing a higher level of detail. 

### Learning Goals:
* Cassandra: My learning goals for this project include learning more about machine learning, creating a complete and user-friendly application, and understanding how to code with more than one person.
* Enmo: My learning goals for this project include learning more about machine learning through applying it on image processing and gaining experience in coding with other people.  
* Hwei-Shin: My learning goals for this project include gaining an in-depth understanding of how machine learning actually works, learning more about how we can use machine learning and image processing together, gaining experience in pair-programming and parsing other peopleâ€™s code/avoiding merge conflicts on GitHub, and gaining more of an intuition for working with different Python packages.
* Josh: I hope to learn to work on a relatively large software project with multiple people and understand machine learning that is just beyond using existing libraries.

### Implementation Plan: 

The project might make heavy use of convolutional neural networks, deep neural networks, and other image related machine learning algorithms. For example, we might use a convolutional neural network to tackle feature extractions in images with various feature maps. Each feature extracted would then be mapped to a RGB value for coloring through deep neural networks.  Once the structure of the coloring algorithm is set up, we will have to train the program to desired specifications through a data set of black-and-white and color images.  As part of the training, for instance, we would need to create a program that converts color images into black and white images and use each pair for training purposes.

### Collaboration plan:

At the beginning of the project, everyone will be doing research together, so we all get an overall idea of our project. After coming up with a concrete structure and plan, we will separate into subteams and pair program within the smaller teams. Possible subteams include image processing and machine learning. We will have weekly check-in meetings and continuously change up the subteams, so everyone can attempt all aspects of the project.

### Risks:

The biggest risk to the success of this project is trying to create a MVP that might be out of our scope. We are all very interested in our project idea, but we understand the fact that it will be very challenging. One obstacle that we acknowledge is the type of black-and-white image that we want to focus on. We could either take grayscale images or comic style images (shading is limited and the objects are outlined in black and the filling is mostly white). Making the choice regarding which test black-and-white images to use would modify the difficulty of our MVP. Grayscale images would be slightly easier to color because it would have all the shading information, but comic-style images might be more interesting to color. Also we would like to generate neural networks from scratch, which could introduce quite a few challenges since we do not have too much experience in machine learning. 

### Additional Course Content: 

Some topics that would be especially helpful for our project include:
* More information about image processing
* Learning about neural networks
* Turning python scripts into an app
* Dealing with code that requires a lot of computational power (Olin supercomputer and multiprocessing)
